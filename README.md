# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all. We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Code of Conduct.

## Our Values

Our community is guided by the following core values:

### Truth and Authenticity

We boldly pursue truth while acknowledging that no one has a monopoly on it. We prioritize being authentic and present facts without compromise or bias, putting truth above ideology and ensuring facts always prevail over opinions. We commit to honest and transparent communication in all our interactions.

### Diversity and Unity

We believe that collective action drives more change than individuals standing alone. We value diversity not only of race, gender, and background but also of ideas. We encourage open-minded, rational debate, genuine exchange of ideas, learning from mistakes, and a community atmosphere that is respectful and collaborative.

### Equality and Empowerment

We support outsiders and believe in breaking conventions to accomplish goals. We advocate for equality of opportunity and the empowerment of individuals, expanding liberty to all and affirming that everyone has potential for leadership and innovation.

### Hopeful and Productive

Our goal is to drive positive change. We stress the importance of hope and productivity over negativity and pessimism. We encourage open-mindedness, hard work towards solutions, and fostering common ground to create a better world together.
