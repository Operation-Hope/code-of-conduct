# About Operation Hope

## Mission

Operation Hope is [TYT](https://tyt.com)’s community organizing, amplifying, and driving positive change. We are creating a partnership with our audience members who want to make a difference in the world. Operation Hope is open to everyone, regardless of political ideology. We know we need to work together if we are going to get things done.

## Elements

### Televising the Revolution

TYT's [The RevolYOUtion segment](https://tyt.com/shows/post-game) following the Main Show is an opportunity for Cenk to put out calls to announce new audience-suggested projects and provide updates on existing projects. We also interview people who can help with the revolution.

### Rey of Hope

TYT hosts periodic virtual town halls with (and often without) Cenk. The town halls have gained a following of die-hard fans and newcomers who want to talk to Cenk AND get involved in some way. We often invite guest speakers to join the event to educate and organize. Through the town hall some examples of action items include creating Trump Brackets (a March Madness-style game allowing people to rank Trump’s worst moments) phone banking for a ballot initiative in Maine to get dark money out of politics.

### Chat TYT

TYT hosts a [planning room](https://discuss.tyt.com/?_gl=1*8ds7fv*_gcl_au*MTM1NDA1MTQzMC4xNzYwMjA4NDU0*_ga*MzMxODQyNDYzLjE3NjAyMDg0NTQ.*_ga_5NHTL8LJC6*czE3NjI4MzUxNzIkbzgkZzEkdDE3NjI4MzUxNzUkajU3JGwwJGgw) where the work of organizing can happen. This is a place for robust discussions, project planning, and community connection. We also have a Discord server for those who prefer to head over there.

### Hopelessly Voted

The Operation Hope team creates polls and petitions located on our website and on other social platforms in order to allow the general public to voice their opinions about pressing topics.

### Operation Joy

This is our campaign to spread joy throughout the internet. You know, because that’s what news networks usually do, right? At TYT, our team and our community all work to make the world a little bit better. But often we feel like we forget to be happy while we’re doing it. Anyone can submit joyful thoughts or actions on our site and they might be read on air!
